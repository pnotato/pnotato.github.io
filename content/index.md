Hi, I'm Nick!

I'm a 4th-year computer science student at Simon Fraser University.  I was previously a co-op student at the [[BC Cancer Research Centre]]. I'm interested in software and data engineering, and how we can use technology to improve the lives of others.

Outside of school, I love hiking and paddling, as well as playing my guitar and watching movies. 

Take a look at my [[projects/index|projects]], or read about my [[experience/index|work experience]].
